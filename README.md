# gene-variation-cancer-prediction
This project predicts cancer types using machine learning by combining structured gene mutation data with unstructured clinical text. It involves feature engineering, text vectorization (TF-IDF), and classification models like Logistic Regression to classify cancer based on genetic and clinical information.
